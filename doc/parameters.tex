In this module are defined all parameters: L, N_thermalization, N_measurements, N_skips, dt, epsilon, lambda, starte and input_file. Contains just one subroutine called read_input that take a file named "parameters.dat" which includes a namelist with the parameters that the user can define for the program:

- N_thermalization: Number of steps to the thermalization
- N_measurements: Number of measurements
- N_skip: Number of skips to take measurements
- L: Spaces for the lattice
- dt: Step of time
- epsilon: Range to consider new candidates at Metropolis algorithm
- lambda: Asymetry parameters
- start: How initialize the array, constant (cold) or aleatory (hot)
